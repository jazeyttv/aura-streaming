# 📱 Phone Access - Complete Guide

## 🎯 **What You Want:**

1. ✅ Stream from your computer (OBS)
2. ✅ Watch on your computer browser
3. ✅ Watch on your phone
4. ✅ Everything works for everyone

---

## 🚀 **Quick Setup (3 Easy Steps):**

### **Step 1: Run This Script**
```bash
.\SETUP_FOR_PHONE.bat
```

This configures everything for network access.

### **Step 2: Restart Everything**
```bash
.\RESTART_CLEAN.bat
```

Wait 30 seconds for servers to start.

### **Step 3: Access**

**On Computer:**
- http://localhost:3000 (still works!)
- OR http://10.8.0.250:3000

**On Phone:**
- http://10.8.0.250:3000
- Login: Jazey / 1919

**OBS Settings:**
- Server: rtmp://localhost:1935/live (or 10.8.0.250)
- Stream Key: (from dashboard)

---

## 🔧 **How It Works:**

### **Network IP: 10.8.0.250**

This is your computer's IP address on your **local WiFi network**.

- ✅ Anyone on your WiFi can access this
- ✅ Your phone (same WiFi) can access this
- ✅ Your computer can access this
- ❌ People on internet CAN'T access (need port forwarding)

---

## 📺 **Video Player:**

We're using **HLS.js** - same as before! It:
- ✅ Plays live streams
- ✅ Works on all browsers
- ✅ Low latency
- ✅ Auto-adjusts quality

The layout changed (Kick-style), but the player is identical!

---

## ⚙️ **Configuration Explained:**

### **Backend (server/config.env):**
```
PUBLIC_IP=10.8.0.250
```
This makes the video URLs use your network IP.

### **Frontend (client/.env):**
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://10.8.0.250:5000
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://10.8.0.250:5000
REACT_APP_MEDIA_URL=http://10.8.0.250:8888
```
This makes the frontend connect to your network IP.

---

## 🔄 **Switching Between Modes:**

### **For Phone Access (Network):**
```bash
.\SETUP_FOR_PHONE.bat
.\RESTART_CLEAN.bat
```

### **For Computer Only (Localhost):**
```bash
.\SETUP_FOR_LOCALHOST.bat
.\RESTART_CLEAN.bat
```

**Always restart after changing config!**

---

## 🧪 **Testing:**

### **1. Test on Computer:**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## ❌ **Troubleshooting:**

### **Phone Can't Connect:**

**Check WiFi:**
- Is phone on SAME WiFi as computer?
- Try: http://10.8.0.250:3000 (not localhost)

**Check Firewall:**
```
1. Windows Defender Firewall
2. Allow Node.js through firewall
3. Or temporarily disable for testing
```

**Check IP Address:**
```
Your IP might have changed! Check with:
ipconfig
Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter
Update SETUP_FOR_PHONE.bat if different
```

### **Video Not Loading:**

**Backend not restarted:**
```
Close backend terminal
Run: RESTART_CLEAN.bat
```

**Browser cache:**
```
Ctrl+Shift+R (hard refresh)
OR
Ctrl+Shift+Delete → Clear cache
```

### **Follow Button 401 Error:**

**Not logged in:**
```
1. Logout
2. Login again (Jazey / 1919)
3. Try follow again
```
