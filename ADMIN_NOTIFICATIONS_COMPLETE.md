## Performance Considerations

- ‚úÖ Announcements limited to 10 active at once (UI)
- ‚úÖ In-memory storage limited to 50 announcements
- ‚úÖ Dismissed announcements stored in localStorage (not on server)
- ‚úÖ Auto-cleanup of expired announcements
- ‚úÖ Socket.IO broadcasts are non-blocking

## Security

- ‚úÖ Only admins can create/delete announcements
- ‚úÖ Authentication required to view announcements
- ‚úÖ Input validation (500 character limit)
- ‚úÖ XSS protection via React's automatic escaping
- ‚úÖ CORS protection maintained

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- üìã Rich text formatting (bold, italic, links)
- üìã Target specific user roles (e.g., only streamers)
- üìã Schedule announcements for future dates
- üìã Analytics (how many users saw/dismissed)
- üìã Announcement templates with variables
- üìã Emoji picker for announcements

## Success! üéâ

The admin notification system is now fully functional! Admins can broadcast important messages to all users instantly, with beautiful UI, real-time updates, and flexible configuration options.

**Perfect for:**
