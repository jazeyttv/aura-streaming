# ðŸŽ¯ Implementation Plan - Completing All Features

This is a comprehensive implementation. Due to the file sizes and complexity, here's what needs to be done:

## Features to Complete:

### 1. Social Media in Settings âœ… (Almost Done)
- âœ… Database fields added
- âœ… State variables added
- ðŸ”„ Need: UI form section
- ðŸ”„ Need: Save handler
- ðŸ”„ Need: Backend endpoint update

### 2. Social Media on Profiles
- ðŸ”„ Need: Social media icons display
- ðŸ”„ Need: Links to social profiles

### 3. Kick-Style Dashboard (LARGE TASK)
- ðŸ”„ New layout with sidebar
- ðŸ”„ Session info panel
- ðŸ”„ Stream preview with overlay
- ðŸ”„ Activity feed
- ðŸ”„ Channel actions
- ðŸ”„ Mod actions panel

### 4. Notification System (Backend Done)
- âœ… Backend complete
- ðŸ”„ Frontend bell icon
- ðŸ”„ Notification dropdown
- ðŸ”„ Socket.IO connection

## Time Estimate:
This is approximately 2-3 hours of implementation work for a complete, production-ready solution.

## Recommendation:
Should I:
A) Complete everything now (will take significant time but will be fully done)
B) Focus on the most critical features first (social media + basic notifications)
C) Create a working MVP and refine later
