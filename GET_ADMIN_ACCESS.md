## 🛠️ If You Already Have Users

If you already created users and need admin access:

### Option A: Create Fresh Database

**Stop everything and delete data:**
```powershell
# Stop servers (Ctrl+C)

# If using MongoDB - delete database
# In MongoDB Compass: Delete "kicky" database

# Restart
START_ALL.bat

# Register again - you'll be admin!
```

### Option B: Manual Admin Access (MongoDB)

**If you have MongoDB running:**

1. Open MongoDB Compass
2. Connect to: `mongodb://localhost:27017`
3. Open database: `kicky`
4. Open collection: `users`
5. Find your user
6. Edit document
7. Change: `"role": "user"` to `"role": "admin"`
8. Save
9. Logout and login again
10. Admin Panel button should appear!

### Option C: Register New Admin Account

Just create a new account if you're using in-memory storage (no MongoDB):
1. Stop servers
2. Start again
3. Register first = admin

## 🎮 Complete Fresh Start

**To start completely fresh:**

```powershell
# 1. Stop all servers (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Clear MongoDB (if using)
# In MongoDB Compass: Delete "kicky" database

## ✅ Verify You're Admin

After getting admin access, verify:

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Don't see Admin Panel button?

**Check 1: Are you the first user?**

- Try logging out and back in
- Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+Del)

**Check 3: Check your role**
- If using MongoDB: Check your user document
- Look for: `"role": "admin"`

### Still no admin access?

**Nuclear option - Complete reset:**

```powershell
# Stop everything
# Delete these if they exist:
# - MongoDB kicky database
# - server/media folder

# Restart
START_ALL.bat

# Register first = you're admin!
```
