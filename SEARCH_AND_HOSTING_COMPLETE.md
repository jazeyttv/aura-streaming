## 📞 **Troubleshooting:**

### **Search not working after restart?**

Check backend logs for:
```
app.use('/api/search', searchRoutes);
```

Should see:
```
✅ MongoDB connected successfully
```

### **404 errors on search?**

Backend needs restart! The search route is new code.

### **Partner badges not showing?**

Check user in database:
```javascript
// In MongoDB
{ isPartner: true }
```

Admin panel → Partner toggle button

### **Colors not saving?**

Check backend:
```
🎨 User Jazey changed chat color to #FF0000
```

If not logging, backend needs restart.
