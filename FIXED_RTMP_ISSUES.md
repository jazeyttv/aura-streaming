# ✅ RTMP Issues Fixed!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: FFmpeg Not Found
**Problem:** Node Media Server couldn't execute FFmpeg  
**Solution:** Changed to use `./ffmpeg.exe` (local file)

### Issue 2: Port 8000 In Use  
**Problem:** Port 8000 was already being used  
**Solution:** Changed HLS port to **8888**

## 🚀 How to Restart & Test

## 🎮 Connect OBS

**Settings:**
- Server: `rtmp://localhost:1935/live`
- Stream Key: (from dashboard at http://localhost:3000)

**Then:**
1. Login: Username `Jazey` / Password `1919`
2. Go to Dashboard
3. Copy your stream key
4. Paste in OBS
5. Click "Start Streaming"
6. Check website - you're LIVE! 🎉

## 📝 Important Changes

**HLS Port Changed:** 8000 → 8888

**Why?** Port 8000 was already in use (probably by another service)

**What this means:**
- Video streams will now be served on port 8888
- RTMP still on port 1935 (unchanged)
- Everything else works the same!

## 🆘 If Still Having Issues

### FFmpeg Still Fails?
Make sure `ffmpeg.exe` is in:
```
C:\Users\wydze\Desktop\Kicky\server\ffmpeg.exe
```

### Port 8888 Also In Use?
Edit `server/media-server.js`:
```javascript
const HTTP_PORT = 8889; // or any free port
```

### OBS Won't Connect?
1. Check RTMP server is running
2. Verify stream key is correct
3. Check firewall isn't blocking port 1935

**Everything should work now!** 🎉
